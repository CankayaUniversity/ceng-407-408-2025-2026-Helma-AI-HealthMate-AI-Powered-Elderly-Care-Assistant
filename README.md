## Project Description
As the global population ages, maintaining the independence, safety, and well-being of elderly individuals has become a growing concern. Many elderly people face challenges in managing their daily routines such as taking medication on time, drinking enough water, and staying physically active. At the same time, family members often struggle to monitor their loved ones’ health and safety effectively.

**Helma AI (HealthMate)** is an **AI-powered elderly care assistant** designed to support elderly individuals in their daily lives while keeping their families informed and connected. The system provides **intelligent reminders** for medication, hydration, and exercise; **emergency alerts** for critical situations such as falls; and **AI-driven communication tools** for natural interaction and companionship.

The project integrates **mobile, backend, and AI technologies** to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for elderly care. The frontend is developed using **Flutter**, while the backend is built with **Spring Boot** and **MongoDB Atlas** to ensure scalable, secure, and real-time data management.
